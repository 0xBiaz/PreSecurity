### **A. SOLID Principles (Simplified)**

The **SOLID** principles are a set of five design guidelines to make object-oriented code more maintainable and scalable:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**  
    A class should have only one reason to change â€” it should do one thing only.
2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):**  
    Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):**  
    Subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes without altering behavior.
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):**  
    Prefer small, specific interfaces over large, general-purpose ones.
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):**  
    Depend on abstractions, not on concrete implementations.

### **B. Practical Example of SOLID Principles**

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Interface Segregation - Define small, focused interfaces
class Readable(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def read(self):
        pass

class Writable(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def write(self, data):
        pass
```

---

```python
# Single Responsibility Principle - Separate reading and writing logic
class FileReader(Readable):
    def __init__(self, filename):
        self.filename = filename
    
    def read(self):
        with open(self.filename, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            return file.read()

class FileWriter(Writable):
    def __init__(self, filename):
        self.filename = filename
    
    def write(self, data):
        with open(self.filename, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            file.write(data)
```

---

```python
# Open/Closed and Dependency Inversion
class DataProcessor:
    def __init__(self, reader: Readable, writer: Writable):
        self.reader = reader
        self.writer = writer
    
    def process_data(self, transform_func=None):
        data = self.reader.read()
        if transform_func:
            data = transform_func(data)
        self.writer.write(data)
        return "Data processed successfully"
```

---

```python
# Easily extendable without modifying existing code
class DatabaseReader(Readable):
    def read(self):
        # Simulated DB read
        return "Data from database"
```

---

### **Usage Example**

```python
def to_upper(text):
    return text.upper()

processor = DataProcessor(
    FileReader("input.txt"),
    FileWriter("output.txt")
)

# processor.process_data(to_upper)  # Uncomment to run
```

### **Summary Tips for SOLID Application:**

- Break large classes into smaller, focused ones.
- Use interfaces (or abstract base classes) to decouple logic.
- Write code that can be extended via inheritance or composition.
- Prefer composition over deep inheritance hierarchies.
