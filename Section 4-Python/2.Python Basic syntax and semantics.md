Python's syntax and semantics are the rules and structure that govern how Python programs are written and understood by the interpreter. Let's break down the basics:
### 1. **Indentation**:
- Python uses **indentation** (whitespace) to define the structure of code blocks instead of curly braces `{}`.
- Consistent indentation is crucial; typically, 4 spaces are used for indentation.

```python
if condition:
    print("True")  # Indentation inside the block
```
### 2. **Variables**:
- Python does not require explicit variable declaration; variables are created when you assign a value to them.
- No need to specify a type; Python automatically determines the type.
```python
x = 10  # Integer
name = "Alice"  # String
is_active = True  # Boolean
```
### 3. **Comments**:
- **Single-line comments** begin with `#`.
- **Multi-line comments** are enclosed by triple quotes `'''` or `"""`.
```python
# This is a single-line comment
"""
This is a multi-line comment.
You can add more lines here.
"""
```
### 4. **Data Types**:
- Python has several built-in data types: `int`, `float`, `str`, `list`, `tuple`, `set`, `dict`, and more.
```python
number = 10       # Integer
price = 3.14      # Float
name = "John"     # String
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]  # List
```
### 5. **Control Flow**:
- **If statements** are used to make decisions.
- **Loops** include `for` and `while` loops.
```python
# If statement
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")

# For loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# While loop
while x < 10:
    x += 1
```
### 6. **Functions**:
- Functions are defined using the `def` keyword.
- A function can accept parameters and return a value.
```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

result = greet("Alice")
print(result)
```
### 7. **Error Handling**:
- Python uses `try`, `except` blocks to handle exceptions (errors).
```python
try:
    result = 10 / 0  # Division by zero
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("You can't divide by zero!")
```
### 8. **Semantics**:

- **Semantics** refers to the meaning and behavior of the code.
- For example, Python assigns meaning to how variables interact, how loops operate, and how functions return values.

9. **Basic Operators**:

- Arithmetic operators: `+`, , , `/`, `//` (integer division), `%` (modulus), `*` (exponentiation).
- Comparison operators: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`.
- Logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`.

```python
x = 5
y = 2
print(x + y)  # Addition
print(x > y)  # Greater than comparison
```
