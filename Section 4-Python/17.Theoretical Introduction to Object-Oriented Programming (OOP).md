### **What is Object-Oriented Programming?**

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which encapsulate **data (attributes)** and **behavior (methods)**.  
Its main goal is to structure code in a way that reflects real-world entities, where each object has properties and behaviors.

### **Procedural vs. Object-Oriented Programming**

|Procedural Programming|Object-Oriented Programming|
|---|---|
|Focuses on functions and procedures|Focuses on objects and their interactions|
|Data and functions are separate|Data and functions are bundled in objects|
|Top-down execution flow|Interactions between objects|
|Harder to maintain and reuse|Easier to maintain and reuse|

### **Four Fundamental OOP Concepts**

#### **1. Encapsulation**

- Hides internal details of an object
- Provides a defined interface for interaction
- Protects data from unwanted external modification

#### **2. Inheritance**

- Creates a new class based on an existing one
- Enables code reuse and extension
- Establishes class hierarchies

#### **3. Polymorphism**

- Different objects can respond to the same interface
- Same operation behaves differently depending on the object
- Increases flexibility in design

#### **4. Abstraction**

- Hides complexity, shows only essential features
- Focuses on **what** rather than **how**
- Simplifies interactions with complex systems
