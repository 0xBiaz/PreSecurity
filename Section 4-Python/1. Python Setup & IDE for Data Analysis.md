## 🧱 Step 1: Install Python
- **Recommended Version:** Python 3.10 or higher  
- **Download Link:** [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)  
- ✔️ On Windows, check `Add Python to PATH` during installation
---
## 🛠️ Step 2: Choose a Package Manager
### ✅ Option 1: Anaconda (Recommended)
- Includes Python + Jupyter + core libraries  
- Download: [https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)
### ✅ Option 2: pip + virtualenv/venv
- Lightweight and flexible for custom setups
---
## 🔒 Step 3: Set Up Virtual Environment
### 🧪 Using `venv` (built-in):
```bash
python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate    # macOS/Linux
myenv\Scripts\activate.bat   # Windows
````
### 🧪 Using `conda`:
```bash
conda create --name myenv python=3.10
conda activate myenv
```
> Replace `myenv` with your preferred environment name.

## 💻 Step 4: Install Key Libraries
### ✅ Using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter notebook ipykernel
```
### ✅ Using conda:
```bash
conda install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
```

## What is IPykernel
pykernel is a powerful tool that serves as a Python kernel for Jupyter notebooks. Built on top of IPython, a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages, ipykernel allows you to execute Python code within Jupyter and other compatible notebooks. This functionality makes it an invaluable asset for data analysis, scientific computing, and machine learning.
