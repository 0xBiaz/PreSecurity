### **A. Object Lifecycle in Python**

In Python, objects go through a lifecycle from creation to destruction. You can hook into key lifecycle events using special methods like:

- `__init__`: Constructor — called when the object is created.
- `__del__`: Destructor — called when the object is about to be destroyed.
- `__enter__` / `__exit__`: Used with the `with` statement to manage resources safely.

### **Context Manager Example with `with` Statement**

```python
class ResourceManager:
    def __init__(self, resource_name):
        self.resource_name = resource_name
        print(f"Resource created: {self.resource_name}")
    
    def __del__(self):
        print(f"Resource cleaned: {self.resource_name}")
    
    def __enter__(self):
        print(f"Using resource: {self.resource_name}")
        return self
    
    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        print(f"Finished using resource: {self.resource_name}")
        if exc_type:
            print(f"An error occurred: {exc_val}")
        return False  # Reraise the exception if any
```

**Usage:**

```python
with ResourceManager("Data File") as rm:
    print("Processing data...")
# Automatically cleaned up after the block
```

### **B. Weak References and Circular Dependency Prevention**

To avoid **memory leaks** caused by circular references (e.g., parent and child referencing each other), use **weak references** from the `weakref` module.

```python
import weakref

class Parent:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.children = []
    
    def add_child(self, child):
        self.children.append(child)
        child.parent = weakref.ref(self)  # Weak reference
```

```python
class Child:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.parent = None

    def get_parent(self):
        if self.parent and self.parent():  # Ensure weakref is still alive
            return self.parent()
        return None
```
