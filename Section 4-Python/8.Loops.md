## üìò What are Loops?

**Loops** are control structures that let you repeat a block of code multiple times. They're fundamental in programming for automating repetitive tasks, iterating over data, and building dynamic logic.

> **Definition:** A loop is a programming construct that repeats a group of commands as long as a specified condition is true.

## üí° Why Use Loops?

- Avoid code duplication
    
- Process collections (lists, strings, etc.)
    
- Build scalable and efficient programs
    
- Automate tasks like reading data, calculations, and more

## üî∏ Types of Loops in Python

|Type|Description|
|---|---|
|`for` loop|Used to iterate over a sequence (list, string...)|
|`while` loop|Repeats as long as a condition is True|

---

## üîπ The `for` Loop

### Syntax:

```python
for variable in iterable:
    # block of code
```

### Example:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

### Using `range()`:

```python
for i in range(5):         # 0 to 4
    print(i)

for i in range(1, 6):      # 1 to 5
    print(i)

for i in range(10, 0, -2): # Countdown
    print(i)
```

---

## üîπ The `while` Loop

### Syntax:

```python
while condition:
    # block of code
```

### Example:

```python
x = 0
while x < 5:
    print(x)
    x += 1
```

> Use `while` when the number of iterations is not known in advance.

## üîπ Loop Control Statements

|Statement|Use Case|
|---|---|
|`break`|Exit the loop immediately|
|`continue`|Skip to next iteration|
|`pass`|Placeholder, does nothing|

### `break` Example:

```python
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)
```

### `continue` Example:

```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        continue
    print(i)
```

### `pass` Example:

```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        pass
    print(i)
```

---

## üîπ Nested Loops

### Example:

```python
for i in range(3):
    for j in range(2):
        print(f"i={i}, j={j}")
```

### Practical: Multiplication Table

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    for j in range(1, 6):
        print(i * j, end="\t")
    print()
```

---

## üîπ Loop Else Clause

- The `else` block executes **only if the loop is not exited via `break`**.
    

```python
for i in range(3):
    print("Try:", i)
    if i == 2:
        break
else:
    print("No break occurred")
```

## üìä Real-World Use Cases

### Login System:

```python
attempts = 3
while attempts > 0:
    pwd = input("Enter password: ")
    if pwd == "1234":
        print("Access granted")
        break
    else:
        print("Wrong password")
        attempts -= 1
```

### Grading System:

```python
scores = [95, 82, 67, 50]

for score in scores:
    if score >= 90:
        print("A")
    elif score >= 80:
        print("B")
    elif score >= 70:
        print("C")
    elif score >= 60:
        print("D")
    else:
        print("F")
```

### Dictionary Iteration:

```python
user = {"name": "Ahmed", "age": 22, "city": "Cairo"}
for key, value in user.items():
    print(key, "->", value)
```

## ‚ùå Common Errors & Pitfalls

|Mistake|Example|Error|
|---|---|---|
|Infinite loop|`while True:` (without `break`)|Program never ends|
|Changing iterable during loop|`for i in list: list.remove(i)`|Unpredictable behavior|
|Off-by-one errors|`range(1, n)` vs `range(1, n+1)`|Missing last value|
|Forgetting to update counter|`while x < 5:` without `x += 1`|Infinite loop|

---

## üéì Looping Tools

### `enumerate()` ‚Äì Index + Item

```python
for index, item in enumerate(["a", "b", "c"]):
    print(index, item)
```

### `zip()` ‚Äì Parallel iteration

```python
names = ["Ahmed", "Sara"]
scores = [90, 95]

for name, score in zip(names, scores):
    print(name, score)
```

## üé® Best Practices

- Use `for` when iterating over collections
    
- Use `while` when repetition depends on a condition
    
- Avoid deep nesting (3+ levels)
    
- Comment your loop logic if complex
    
- Watch out for infinite loops

## üéì Practice Problems

1. Print even numbers between 1 and 100
    
2. Password checker with 3 attempts
    
3. Simple calculator using `while` until `exit` entered
    
4. Loop over names and print only those starting with "A"
    
5. Print this pattern using nested loops:
