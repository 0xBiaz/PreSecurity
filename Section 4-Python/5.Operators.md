### Operators in Python 
Operators are symbols used to perform operations on variables and values. Python supports a wide variety of operators that can be categorized into several types. Let's dive deep into these operators.

### 1. **Arithmetic Operators**

Arithmetic operators are used to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.

|Operator|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|`+`|Addition|`a + b`|
|`-`|Subtraction|`a - b`|
|`*`|Multiplication|`a * b`|
|`/`|Division|`a / b`|
|`//`|Floor Division|`a // b`|
|`%`|Modulus (Remainder)|`a % b`|
|`**`|Exponentiation (Power)|`a ** b`|

#### Examples:

```python
a = 10
b = 5

print(a + b)    # Output: 15
print(a - b)    # Output: 5
print(a * b)    # Output: 50
print(a / b)    # Output: 2.0
print(a // b)   # Output: 2
print(a % b)    # Output: 0
print(a ** b)   # Output: 100000
```

- **Floor Division (`//`)**: Returns the integer quotient, discarding the decimal part.
    
- **Exponentiation (`**`)**: Raises a number to the power of another number.
    

### 2. **Comparison (Relational) Operators**

These operators are used to compare two values. They return `True` or `False` depending on whether the comparison is true.

|Operator|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|`==`|Equal to|`a == b`|
|`!=`|Not equal to|`a != b`|
|`>`|Greater than|`a > b`|
|`<`|Less than|`a < b`|
|`>=`|Greater than or equal to|`a >= b`|
|`<=`|Less than or equal to|`a <= b`|

#### Examples:

```python
a = 10
b = 5

print(a == b)  # Output: False
print(a != b)  # Output: True
print(a > b)   # Output: True
print(a < b)   # Output: False
print(a >= b)  # Output: True
print(a <= b)  # Output: False
```

### 3. **Logical Operators**

Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements and perform logical operations.

|Operator|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|`and`|Returns `True` if both operands are true|`a > 5 and b < 10`|
|`or`|Returns `True` if at least one operand is true|`a > 5 or b < 10`|
|`not`|Returns the opposite boolean value|`not(a > 5)`|

#### Examples:

```python
a = 10
b = 5

print(a > 5 and b < 10)  # Output: True
print(a > 15 or b < 10)  # Output: True
print(not(a > 5))        # Output: False
```

- **`and`**: Only returns `True` if both conditions are true.
    
- **`or`**: Returns `True` if at least one condition is true.
    
- **`not`**: Reverses the logical state.
    

### 4. **Assignment Operators**

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. They modify the value of a variable in place.

|Operator|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|`=`|Assigns a value to a variable|`x = 5`|
|`+=`|Adds a value to the variable|`x += 3` (equivalent to `x = x + 3`)|
|`-=`|Subtracts a value from the variable|`x -= 3` (equivalent to `x = x - 3`)|
|`*=`|Multiplies the variable by a value|`x *= 3` (equivalent to `x = x * 3`)|
|`/=`|Divides the variable by a value|`x /= 3` (equivalent to `x = x / 3`)|
|`//=`|Floor divides the variable by a value|`x //= 3` (equivalent to `x = x // 3`)|
|`%=`|Modulus (remainder) of the variable|`x %= 3` (equivalent to `x = x % 3`)|
|`**=`|Raises the variable to the power of a value|`x **= 3` (equivalent to `x = x ** 3`)|

#### Examples:

```python
x = 5
x += 3    # x = x + 3 => x = 8
x -= 2    # x = x - 2 => x = 6
x *= 4    # x = x * 4 => x = 24
x /= 2    # x = x / 2 => x = 12.0
x //= 3   # x = x // 3 => x = 4
x %= 3    # x = x % 3 => x = 1
x **= 2   # x = x ** 2 => x = 1
```

### 5. **Identity Operators**

Identity operators are used to compare the memory locations of two objects. These are used to check if two variables point to the same object in memory.

|Operator|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|`is`|Returns `True` if both variables point to the same object|`a is b`|
|`is not`|Returns `True` if both variables do not point to the same object|`a is not b`|

#### Examples:

```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [1, 2, 3]
c = a

print(a is b)     # Output: False (different memory locations)
print(a is c)     # Output: True (same memory location)
print(a is not b) # Output: True
```

- **`is`**: Checks if two variables point to the same object in memory.
    
- **`is not`**: Checks if two variables do not point to the same object in memory.
    

### 6. **Membership Operators**

Membership operators are used to test if a sequence (like a list, tuple, string) contains a specific item.

|Operator|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|`in`|Returns `True` if a value is present in a sequence|`x in y`|
|`not in`|Returns `True` if a value is not present in a sequence|`x not in y`|

#### Examples:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

print("apple" in fruits)    # Output: True
print("orange" not in fruits) # Output: True
```

- **`in`**: Checks if the value exists in a sequence (list, string, etc.).
    
- **`not in`**: Checks if the value does not exist in a sequence.
    

### 7. **Bitwise Operators**

Bitwise operators operate on the individual bits of integer values. They are typically used in low-level programming or working with binary data.

|Operator|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|`&`|Bitwise AND|`a & b`|
|`|`|Bitwise OR|
|`^`|Bitwise XOR (exclusive OR)|`a ^ b`|
|`~`|Bitwise NOT (complement)|`~a`|
|`<<`|Left shift|`a << b`|
|`>>`|Right shift|`a >> b`|

#### Examples:

```python
a = 10  # 1010 in binary
b = 4   # 0100 in binary

print(a & b)  # Output: 0 (1010 & 0100 = 0000)
print(a | b)  # Output: 14 (1010 | 0100 = 1110)
print(a ^ b)  # Output: 14 (1010 ^ 0100 = 1110)
print(~a)     # Output: -11 (~1010 = -1011)
print(a << 1) # Output: 20 (left shift by 1: 1010 becomes 10100)
print(a >> 1) # Output: 5  (right shift by 1: 1010 becomes 0101)
```

### 8. **Ternary Conditional Operator (Inline If)**

Python has a conditional expression that allows for a one-line if-else statement.

|Operator|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|`condition_if_true if condition else condition_if_false`|Conditional expression|`x if a > b else y`|

#### Example:

```python
a = 10
b = 5

result = "a is greater" if a > b else "b is greater"
print(result)  # Output: a is greater
```
