## 📘 What is File Handling?

> **Definition:** File handling in Python allows you to read, write, update, and delete files directly from your Python code, enabling persistent storage and data exchange.

Python has a built-in `open()` function to interact with files using various modes like read (`"r"`), write (`"w"`), append (`"a"`), and more.

---

## 🧾 File Open Modes

|Mode|Description|
|---|---|
|`'r'`|Read (default), file must exist|
|`'w'`|Write, creates new or overwrites existing file|
|`'a'`|Append, writes at the end of file|
|`'x'`|Exclusive creation, fails if file exists|
|`'b'`|Binary mode (e.g., `'rb'`, `'wb'`)|
|`'t'`|Text mode (default, `'rt'`)|
|`'+'`|Read and write mode (e.g., `'r+'`, `'w+'`)|

## 🛠 Opening and Closing Files

```python
file = open("example.txt", "r")
content = file.read()
file.close()
```

### ✅ Best Practice: Use `with` Statement

Automatically handles file closing, even on errors.

```python
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
```

---

## 📖 Reading from Files

### 1. `read()` – Read entire content

```python
with open("data.txt", "r") as f:
    print(f.read())
```

### 2. `readline()` – Read one line at a time

```python
with open("data.txt") as f:
    print(f.readline())
```

### 3. `readlines()` – Read all lines into a list

```python
with open("data.txt") as f:
    lines = f.readlines()
    print(lines)
```

---

## 📝 Writing to Files

### 1. `write()` – Writes string data

```python
with open("output.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Hello, world!\n")
    f.write("Another line.")
```

### 2. `writelines()` – Write a list of lines

```python
lines = ["First line\n", "Second line\n"]
with open("output.txt", "w") as f:
    f.writelines(lines)
```

### 🚨 Warning:

- Writing with `'w'` **overwrites** the file.
    
- Use `'a'` to **append** without losing existing data.

## 🔄 Appending to Files

```python
with open("log.txt", "a") as f:
    f.write("New log entry\n")
```

---

## 📂 Working with Files and Directories

```python
import os

# Check if file exists
print(os.path.exists("data.txt"))

# Get file size
print(os.path.getsize("data.txt"))

# Rename file
os.rename("old.txt", "new.txt")

# Delete file
os.remove("unwanted.txt")
```

---

## 🧪 Reading & Writing CSV Files

```python
import csv

# Write
with open("people.csv", "w", newline='') as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    writer.writerow(["Name", "Age"])
    writer.writerow(["Ali", 25])

# Read
with open("people.csv") as f:
    reader = csv.reader(f)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)
```

---

## 📦 Working with JSON Files

```python
import json

data = {"name": "Sara", "age": 28}

# Write JSON
with open("data.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(data, f)

# Read JSON
with open("data.json") as f:
    content = json.load(f)
    print(content)
```

## ❌ Common File Handling Errors

|Error|Cause/Scenario|
|---|---|
|`FileNotFoundError`|Trying to read a non-existent file|
|`PermissionError`|No write permissions for the file/folder|
|`IsADirectoryError`|Attempted to open a directory as a file|
|`ValueError`|Operating on closed file|

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- Always use `with open(...)` to safely manage files
    
- Handle exceptions with `try`/`except`
    
- Always specify encoding (`utf-8`) for non-ASCII files
    
- Use `os.path.exists()` before reading or deleting files
    
- Use context managers and `csv`/`json` modules for structured data

## 🧩 Real Use Case: Logging System

```python
import datetime

def log_event(message):
    with open("events.log", "a") as f:
        timestamp = datetime.datetime.now()
        f.write(f"{timestamp}: {message}\n")

log_event("User logged in")
log_event("User performed an action")
```

## 📦 Reading and Writing Binary Files in Python

Binary files (e.g., images, audio, executables) store data in a format not readable as plain text. You need to use `'rb'` and `'wb'` modes for reading/writing such files.

---

### 📥 Reading Binary Files (`rb`)

```python
with open("photo.jpg", "rb") as file:
    binary_data = file.read()

print(type(binary_data))  # <class 'bytes'>
print(binary_data[:20])   # Print first 20 bytes
```

---

### 📤 Writing Binary Files (`wb`)

```python
# Copy an image file
with open("photo.jpg", "rb") as source:
    data = source.read()

with open("copy.jpg", "wb") as dest:
    dest.write(data)
```

---

### 💡 Practical Use Case: Saving Uploaded Files (e.g., in Web Apps)

```python
def save_uploaded_file(uploaded_bytes, filename):
    with open(filename, "wb") as f:
        f.write(uploaded_bytes)

# Simulating an upload
uploaded_data = b'\x89PNG\r\n\x1a\n\x00\x00\x00\rIHDR...'
save_uploaded_file(uploaded_data, "upload.png")
```

---

### 🧠 Tips & Notes

- Binary mode (`b`) works for both reading (`rb`) and writing (`wb`).
    
- Use binary mode for non-text files (images, videos, PDFs).
    
- Binary data is returned as `bytes`, not `str`.
    
- Use `rb+` or `wb+` for read/write in binary mode.
