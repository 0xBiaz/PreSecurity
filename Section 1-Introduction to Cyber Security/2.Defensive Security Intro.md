Defensive security is concerned with two main tasks
- Preventing intrusions from occurring
- Detecting intrusions when they occur and responding properly

the Blue teams are part of the defensive security landscape.

Some of the tasks that are related to defensive security include:

- User cyber security awareness: Training users about cyber security helps protect against attacks targeting their systems.
- Documenting and managing assets: We need to know the systems and devices we must manage and protect adequately.
- Updating and patching systems: Ensuring that computers, servers, and network devices are correctly updated and patched against any known vulnerability (weakness).
- Setting up preventative security devices:Â firewallÂ and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) are critical components of preventative security. Firewalls control what network traffic can go inside and what can leave the system or network.Â IPSÂ blocks any network traffic that matches present rules and attack signatures.
- Setting up logging and monitoring devices: Proper network logging and monitoring are essential for detecting malicious activities and intrusions. If a new unauthorized device appears on our network, we should be able to detect it.

### Security Operations Center (SOC):
A **Security Operations Center (SOC)** is a team of cybersecurity experts who **monitor and protect** an organizationâ€™s systems and networks. Their main job is to **detect, respond to, and prevent** cyberattacks.
### Key responsibilities of a SOC:
- **Vulnerabilities**: Find and help fix weak points in systems before hackers exploit them.
- **Policy Violations**: Watch for actions that break security rules, like sharing private data online.
- **Unauthorized Activity**: Detect if someone is using stolen login details and stop them quickly.
- **Network Intrusions**: Catch hackers who break into the system and stop the attack fast.

### **Threat Intelligence**:
**Threat Intelligence** is information collected about **cyber threats and attackers** to help an organization **prepare and defend itself** better.
It helps security teams understand:
- **Who** might attack (e.g., hackers, cybercriminals, or nation-states)
- **Why** they might attack (e.g., to steal data or cause disruption)
- **How** they might attack (e.g., phishing, malware, ransomware)
The goal is to build a **threat-informed defense**, tailored to the company's specific risks and enemies.
### Example:
- A **mobile company** might be targeted for customer data.
- A **petroleum refinery** might be targeted to stop production.

### **Digital Forensics :**
**Digital Forensics** is the science of collecting, analyzing, and preserving digital evidence from computers, phones, and networks to **investigate cybercrimes or security incidents**.
It helps answer:  
**What happened? Who did it? How did it happen?**
### Key Areas of Digital Forensics:

1. **File System Analysis:**  
    By examining a forensic image (low-level copy) of the disk, we can discover:
    - Installed software
    - Created and deleted files
    - File manipulation and traces
2. **System Memory (RAM):**  
    If malware runs only in memory, analyzing a snapshot of system RAM can reveal:
    - Running malicious code
    - Processes and activity not saved to disk
3. **System Logs:**  
    Logs record user actions and system events:
    - Logins, errors, updates
    - Even if attackers delete traces, some logs usually remain
4. **Network Logs:**  
    Logs of network traffic help answer:
    - Was there an attack?
    - What kind of attack?
    - Where did it come from?

Use Cases:
- Cybercrime investigation
- Intellectual property theft
- Cyber espionage detection
- Proving or disproving insider threats

### **What is Malware Analysis?**
**Malware** stands for **malicious software** â€” bad programs designed to harm your computer, steal your data, or lock your files.
**Malware Analysis** is the process of studying these harmful programs to understand:
- How they work
- What damage they cause
- How to stop them

Common Types of Malware:
1. **Virus**  
    A small piece of code that attaches to programs.  
    Once it runs, it spreads, changes files, or deletes them.  
    It can make your system slow or completely unusable.
2. **Trojan Horse**  
    A program that pretends to be useful (like a video player),  
    but secretly gives the hacker access to your system.
3. **Ransomware**  
    It encrypts your files (makes them unreadable).  
    Then demands money ("ransom") to unlock them.
### How Do We Analyze Malware?
There are two main ways:
1. **Static Analysis**
    - You **look at the malwareâ€™s code** without running it.
    - Like reading the recipe without cooking the food.
    - Requires good knowledge of **assembly language** and file structures.
2. **Dynamic Analysis**
    - You **run the malware in a safe, controlled environment** (sandbox).
    - You watch what it does: Does it open connections? Change files?
    - Itâ€™s like putting the malware in a lab and observing it.
### ðŸŽ¯ Why Do We Analyze Malware?
- To **understand how it works**
- To **detect and remove it**
- To **protect systems in the future**
