## Linux History
### Historical Background of Linux

- **1970**: **Unix** was created by **Ken Thompson** and **Dennis Ritchie** at AT&T.
- **1977**: **BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution)** was released but faced legal issues because it included Unix code owned by AT&T.
- **1983**: **Richard Stallman** launched the **GNU Project** to build a free Unix-like OS.
    - This led to the creation of the **GNU General Public License (GPL)**.
- Several early projects failed to create a usable free kernel until **Linux**.
### The Birth of the Linux Kernel

- **1991**: **Linus Torvalds**, a Finnish student, started developing a new, free kernel as a personal project.
- What began as a small project in **C** evolved into a kernel with **23+ million lines of code**.
- Licensed under **GNU GPL v2**, allowing open use, modification, and distribution.
### Linux Distributions (Distros)

- A **distribution (distro)** = Linux kernel + supporting software + libraries.
- Over **600 distributions** exist.
- Popular examples:
    - **Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, OpenSUSE, Manjaro, elementary OS, Gentoo, RedHat, Linux Mint**.
###  Advantages of Linux

- **Security**: More secure and less vulnerable to malware than Windows.
- **Stability**: Reliable with strong performance.
- **Open Source**: Anyone can view, modify, and redistribute the source code.
- **Versatility**: Runs on servers, desktops, embedded systems, and more.
- **Widespread**: Powers Android, making it the **most installed OS** worldwide.
### Challenges of Linux
- Can be **more difficult for beginners**.
- **Fewer hardware drivers** compared to Windows (though this is improving).
### Linux Metaphor: A Company Analogy

- Think of **Linux as a company**:
    - **Components = Employees** with defined roles (e.g., kernel, shell, libraries).
    - **Architecture = Organizational Structure** that ensures coordination.
    - **Philosophy = Company Culture** promoting:
        - **Simplicity**
        - **Transparency**
        - **Cooperation**

## Linux Philosophy Overview
The **Linux philosophy** emphasizes:
- **Simplicity**: Keep things minimal and understandable.
- **Modularity**: Build small tools with a single purpose.
- **Openness**: Transparent code and user control.

### Five Core Principles of Linux
 - Everything is a file
 - Small, single-purpose programs
 - Chain programs for complex tasks
 - **Avoid captive user interfaces**
 - Store configuration in text files

## **Linux Components Explained**

|**Component**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**üîß Bootloader**|A small program that **starts the booting process** and loads the operating system. Example: **GRUB** used in Parrot Linux.|
|**üß† OS Kernel**|The **core of the operating system**. It manages communication between **hardware and software**, including memory, CPU, and device input/output.|
|**üëª Daemons**|Background **services** that run without user interaction. They handle system tasks like **printing, scheduling, networking**, etc.|
|**üíª OS Shell**|The **interface between user and system** (usually the terminal). It lets users enter commands. Common shells: **Bash**, **Zsh**, **Fish**, etc.|
|**üñ•Ô∏è Graphics Server**|Provides a **graphical system** (usually called **X** or **X-server**) that allows programs with a GUI to display graphics on the screen.|
|**ü™ü Window Manager**|The **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** layer. Popular ones include **GNOME**, **KDE**, **Cinnamon**, etc. It controls how windows look and behave.|
|**üõ†Ô∏è Utilities**|Small **applications or tools** that perform specific tasks (e.g., file manager, text editor, system monitor).|

### üîÅ **How They Work Together (Quick Flow):**
1. **Bootloader** starts the system.
2. **Kernel** loads and begins managing hardware.
3. **Daemons** start running in the background.
4. **Shell** or **GUI** provides an interface to the user.
5. **Graphics server** enables visual programs to display on screen.
6. **Window manager** gives you the desktop experience.
7. **Utilities** allow you to interact and perform specific tasks.

## Linux Architecture
The Linux operating system can be broken down into layers:

|**Layer**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`Hardware`|Peripheral devices such as the system's RAM, hard drive, CPU, and others.|
|`Kernel`|The core of the Linux operating system whose function is to virtualize and control common computer hardware resources like CPU, allocated memory, accessed data, and others. The kernel gives each process its own virtual resources and prevents/mitigates conflicts between different processes.|
|`Shell`|A command-line interface (**CLI**), also known as a shell that a user can enter commands into to execute the kernel's functions.|
|`System Utility`|Makes available to the user all of the operating system's functionality.|

## File System Hierarchy
The Linux operating system is structured in a tree-like hierarchy

| **Path** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/`      | The top-level directory is the root filesystem and contains all of the files required to boot the operating system before other filesystems are mounted, as well as the files required to boot the other filesystems. After boot, all of the other filesystems are mounted at standard mount points as subdirectories of the root. |
| `/bin`   | Contains essential command binaries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
